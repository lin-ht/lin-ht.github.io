Hi, dear visitor, nice to meet you! Let me briefly introduce myself. I love solving real world computation photography, computer vision, and graphic problems. Currently, I focus on tech transfer in Adobe's Emerging Product Group (EPG), integrating the most advanced solutions into Adobe's products. I not only optimize implementations under computation or memory constraints, but also improve the algorithms to achieve the ultimate quality. 

I graduated from Computer Science department in [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en) in 2008. I got a Phd degree from [NUS](https://nus.edu.sg/) in 2013 under the supervise of Prof. [Michael S. Brown](https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~mbrown/). My [dissertation](https://nus.edu.sg/) topic was camera pipeline modeling. After that, I joined [Graphics & Imaging Lab](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/wiki/graphics/index.php/Main/Homepage) in [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/) as a post doc under Prof. [Jingyi yu](http://www.yu-jingyi.com/) working on the ray geometry of light field and multi-view 3D reconstruction.

My research interests include computational photography, computer vision, and machine learning.
