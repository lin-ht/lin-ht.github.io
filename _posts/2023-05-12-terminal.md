#### Useful commands

<a href="https://linuxize.com/post/chmod-recursive/">Change permisson</a>:
{% highlight bash %}
# Make the script files executable
chmod a+x scripts/*.sh

# recursively option -R or --recursive
chmod -R 755 /path/to/directory

# To change all the directories to 755 (drwxr-xr-x):
find /path/to/directory -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
# To change all the files to 644 (-rw-r--r--):
find /path/to/directory -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

# Use the xargs command to pass multiple entries at once
sudo find /path/to/directory -type d -print0 | xargs -0 sudo chmod 755
sudo find /path/to/directory -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sudo chmod 644
{% endhighlight %}

`chmod 755 {}` specifies the command that will be executed by find for each directory

`chmod 644 {}` specifies the command that will be executed by find for each file

`{}` is replaced by the path

`;` the semicolon tells find that this is the end of the command it's supposed to execute

`\;` the semicolon is escaped, otherwise it would be interpreted by the shell instead of find


<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/444596/how-to-change-the-default-shell-to-bash-in-macos-catalina/">Change default shell on macOS</a>:
{% highlight bash %}
cat /etc/shells # List the included shells on the system
chsh -s /bin/bash # Change default terminal to bash

{% highlight bash %}
du -sh [--apparent-size] <dir> # the total (-s) size of the directory in (-h) human readable format
du -h --max-depth=1 <dir> # disk usage of the first-level subdirectories
sudo du -h <dir> | sort -rh | head -5 # print the 5 largest directories within the dir directory
{% endhighlight %}

```bash
df -h
```

<a href="#">Zip</a> and <a href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-extract-unzip-tar-gz-file">unzip</a>:

# option -x: extraction
#        -v: verbose

# Extract certain files or diretories

grep --include=\*.{c,h} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
grep --exclude=\*.o -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
grep --exclude-dir={dir1,dir2,*.dst} -rnw '/path/to/search/' -e "pattern"
# output the line number only
grep -n '/path/to/somefile' -e "pattern" | cut -f1 -d:
# output the two words separated by the delimiter :
grep -n '/path/to/somefile' -e "pattern" | cut -f1,2 -d:
# loop over the returned result
for i in $(grep -n '/path/to/somefile' -e "pattern" | cut -f1 -d:); do 
    echo "$i"
done
# return only the first result
grep -n '/path/to/somefile' -e "pattern" | head -1
{% endhighlight %}

sed -i 's+word1+word2+g' input
sed -i 's_word1_word2_g' input

# only find word1 and replace it with word2 if line has a specific string such as FOO
sed -i -e '/FOO/s/word1/word2/' input.txt

# replace entire line 7 by line number
sed -i -e '7s/.*/line_replacement/' input.txt
# sed uses symbol $ as the address of the last line
sed -i -e '$s/.*/line_replacement/' input.txt

# insert a new line at line 3
sed -i "3inew line content" input.txt
# insert a new line at the line of the first matched pattern
